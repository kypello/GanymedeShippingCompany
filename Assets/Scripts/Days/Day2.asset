  storyText: Good morning! As of today, we are allowed ship to other planetary systems
    as long as we use a valid Interplanetary Visa. Make sure the ID and Destination
    match what's written on the package and we are good to go. There's an embargo
    preventing us from shipping through the Asteroid Belt however, so you can only
    ship packages to the Gas Giants, as well as anything further out.
